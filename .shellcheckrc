# SC1091: Not following sourced files (we handle this in tests)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (some are used by sourcing scripts)
# SC2249: Consider adding a default *) case (style preference, not error)
# SC2250: Prefer ${var} over $var (style preference, both are valid bash)
disable=SC1091,SC2034,SC2249,SC2250

# External sources - paths to search for sourced files
# source-path=scripts

# Don't warn about these specific patterns
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
